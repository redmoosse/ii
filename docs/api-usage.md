2. Provide `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from Google OAuth2 Console.

```http

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "code from google"
}
```
```json
{
  "access_token": "your-jwt-token",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### 2. Username & Password Login (TODO)

You can also authenticate by sending a POST request to `/auth/login`:

```http
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

Successful response:

```json

- Models are served dynamically based on the `DOCKER_MODEL` setting therefore response may be different.
